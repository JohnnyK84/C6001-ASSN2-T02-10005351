## Personal Journal - Johnny Kingi - Assessment 2

The following journal for GUI Programing-C6002 will outline my contribution towards the project.
Our first team meeting took place on Monday, 04 Septemer, after a small discussion regarding team roles it was decided that I
would be tasked with the role of team leader. Other key points discussed at our team meeting were:

* An idea for an Application and what API's we were going to incorporate
* Brainstorm and draft possible wireframe ideas for layout
* User Stories
* Come up with a plan to achieve goals for Milestone one and delegate tasks

Possible tools and the benefits they offer were also discussed in our meeting. I favored Github over Bitbucket and decided that
I would set up our group repository. I also setup a Google Doc which I shared with the team and began to add content relevant to our
report, as discussed in our meeting.

At our second meeting on Wednesday, 06 Septemer, we continued to breakdown tasks for Milestone One. While Stephen worked on our report, Taylor
and I worked alongside Olena to come up with a final draft Wireframe of our applilcation. Olena was then tasked with the job of completing our 
final wireframe for our report. I have since added the completed wireframes to our report. The team will continue to add any necessary content 
to the report over the coming weekend while also continuing to resaerch APIs in preparing for our next meeting Wednesday, 13 Setember

I feel I have also played a strong part in overall communication and co-ordination of our team. Our team is working very well together thus
far and everyone is contributing equally. I will do the final proof read of our report before making the submission on Monday, 11 Setember.
