## Personal Journal - Johnny Kingi - Assessment 2

The following journal for GUI Programing-C6002 will outline my contribution towards the project.
Our first team meeting took place on Monday, 04 September, after a small discussion regarding team roles it was decided that I
would be tasked with the role of team leader. Other key points discussed at our team meeting were:

* An idea for an Application and what API's we were going to incorporate
* Brainstorm and draft possible wireframe ideas for layout
* User Stories
* Come up with a plan to achieve goals for Milestone one and delegate tasks

Possible tools and the benefits they offer were also discussed in our meeting. I favoured GitHub over Bitbucket and decided that
I would set up our group repository. I also setup a Google Doc which I shared with the team and began to add content relevant to our
report, as discussed in our meeting. Other tools we decided on in our team meeting were:

* Draw.io For wireframing
* Visual Studio Code to code the app

At our second meeting on Wednesday, 06 September, we continued to breakdown tasks for Milestone One. While Stephen worked on our report, Taylor and I worked alongside Olena to come up with a final draft Wireframe of our application. Olena was then tasked with the job of completing our final wireframe for our report. I have since added the completed wireframes to our report. The team will continue to add any necessary content to the report over the coming weekend while also continuing to research APIs in preparation for our next meeting Wednesday, 13 September. This meeting will be used breakdown tasks for Milestone 2 and to formulate a plan of how we are going to constuct the application.

I feel I have also played a strong part in overall communication and co-ordination of our team. Our team is working very well together thus far and everyone is contributing equally. I will do the final proof read of our report before making the submission on Monday, 11 Setember.
